# Roadmap

## Next improvements
- Full course editor map-pick mode for front/middle/back + hazards per hole.
- Dedicated recap share card layout for screenshot exports.
- Rich score metrics (fairways by par-4/par-5 only, scrambling, up/down).
- Import/export course and round JSON backups.
- Better geolocation smoothing and accuracy ring rendering.
